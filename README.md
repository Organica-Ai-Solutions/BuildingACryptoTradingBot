## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- Alpaca trading account (paper or live)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Organica-Ai-Solutions/BuildingACryptoTradingBot.git
cd BuildingACryptoTradingBot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Alpaca API credentials:
```
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key
ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
ALPACA_API_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets  # For paper trading
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask application:
```bash
python -m backend.app
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5001
```

## Trading Strategies

### Supertrend Strategy
The Supertrend strategy uses a trend-following indicator that combines ATR (Average True Range) with basic price action to identify potential entry and exit points. The enhanced version includes:

- Volume confirmation for reduced false signals
- Dynamic parameter adjustment based on market volatility
- Adaptive risk-reward ratios based on market regime
- Performance tracking with automatic optimization
- Trend strength analysis for better entries

### MACD Strategy
The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) strategy uses momentum and trend following to generate trading signals based on moving average crossovers.

## Risk Management

The trading bot includes advanced risk management features:

1. **Position Sizing**: Calculates position size based on account size and defined risk percentage per trade
2. **Stop Loss Orders**: Automatically places stop loss orders based on technical levels
3. **Take Profit Orders**: Sets intelligent take profit levels with dynamic reward-risk ratios
4. **Maximum Drawdown Protection**: Monitors overall portfolio performance to prevent excessive losses
5. **Trade Frequency Limits**: Implements cooldown periods to prevent overtrading
6. **Maximum Position Size**: Limits the maximum size of any position as a percentage of portfolio

## Automated Trading

The bot includes full automation capabilities:

1. **Default Strategies**: Automatically initializes and starts trading with pre-configured strategies
2. **24/7 Operation**: Continuously monitors markets for trading opportunities
3. **Error Recovery**: Implements robust error handling and automatic recovery
4. **Performance Optimization**: Dynamically adjusts strategy parameters based on performance
5. **Multi-Symbol Trading**: Trades multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously with batched processing

## Backtesting and Optimization

The platform includes tools for strategy development:

1. **Historical Data Backtesting**: Test strategies against historical data
2. **Parameter Optimization**: Find optimal parameters for each trading pair
3. **Performance Analytics**: Track win rate, average profit, and drawdown statistics
4. **Market Regime Detection**: Identifies trending, volatile, or ranging market conditions

## Configuration

All trading parameters can be configured through the web interface:

1. Trading Settings:
   - Paper/Live trading mode
   - Maximum concurrent trades
   - Default strategy capital
   - Risk per trade
   - Take profit/Stop loss levels

2. API Settings:
